However, there's no change in the objective value which is still 382.2. This implies that even though the charging period has been prolonged, the model is able to meet the target charge by choosing the least costly hours, hence the total cost didn't change. This is because the model is capable of selecting the optimal hours with the minimum cost within the allowed charging period.\n",
