      "Before decreasing the maximum charge power to 11 KW, we had achieved an optimization objective value of 327.6. After making the change, we re-ran the optimization problem and received the same objective value, which is also 327.6. Since a lower objective value implies a better solution in this context, we can conclude that the adjustment of maximum charge power didn't lead to an improvement in our solution. It implies that we are already operating at an optimal level, so reducing the maximum charging power didn't practically impact the outcome of the optimization.\n",
